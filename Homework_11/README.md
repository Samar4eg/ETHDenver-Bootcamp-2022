# Homework 11

Continue developing your Volcano NFT project

***1. Add a function that allows a user to mint an NFT if they pay 0.01 ETH, or an amount of Volcano coin (decide on a price yourself).***  
TO DO: payment using Volcano Coin

***2. Make sure that when a token is minted we can specify a token URI - a location where we can store metadata / images for the NFT.***  
Done using [Render](https://render.com/) to host a Node js app for storing image and [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) to share local host api where metadata for tokenID n.1 are stored.

***3. What would be the problem with providing a function to allow us to change the token URI?***
