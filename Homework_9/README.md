**Volcano NFT**  
We now want to create an NFT. We will use the Open Zeppelin libraries to help with this.

***1. Create a new project in the IDE of you choice called NFTProject***

***2. Create a VolcanoNFT contract. This should inherit from any ERC721 implementation from the Open Zeppelin standard libraries ([Link](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721))***

***3. Give your NFT a name and a symbol.***

***4. Write unit tests to check that you can:***  
  ***- Mint new NFTs***  
  ***- Transfer an NFT***
  
***5. Deploy your contract to Goerli and send some NFTs to your colleagues.***

- contract deployment tx hash on Goerli  
- contract address overview  
- VolcanoNFT transactions
