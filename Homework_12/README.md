**Team Gas Optimisation Game**

Original [repo](https://github.com/ExtropyIO/SolidityBootcamp)  
Aim: reduce the amount of gas used to deploy the contract, and when running transactions.  

***NOTE***

- Created a new file "GasContractOptimized.sol" for reducing amount of gas. Reduced gas spent of about 50%.  
- Test file has not been changed, and all the tests have been successful. To run the tests using hardhat as suggested, change the name of the contract within the test file, in the field "ContractFactory".    
- Produced storage and class diagram using the "sol2uml" tool for the GasContract and the GasContractOptimized. These are available into the Gas folder.  
- Produced also screenshots of test output for both the contracts, and UML files using the Solidity Visual Developer extension. These are available in the Homework_12 folder.
