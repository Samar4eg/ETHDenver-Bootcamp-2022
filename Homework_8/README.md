# Homework 8

**Using your choice of hardhat, foundry or truffle:**

***1. Create a project for your Volcano coin***  
***2. Write unit tests for your Volcano coin contract***

**The tests should show that:**

***1. The total supply is initially 10000***  
***2. That the total supply can be increased in 1000 token steps***  
***3. Only the owner of the contract can increase the supply***
